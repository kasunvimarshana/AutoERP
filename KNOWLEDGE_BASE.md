# 5. Architecture

Architecture:  
Controller → Service → Handler (Pipeline) → Repository → Entity

---

# 6. Multi-UOM Design

uom — inventory/stock-tracking UOM (base unit; always required)  
buying_uom — purchasing UOM (optional; falls back to uom)  
selling_uom — sales UOM (optional; falls back to uom)  
uom_conversions table stores product-specific factors (e.g. 1 box = 12 pcs)  
Conversion supports direct path (from_uom → to_uom) and inverse path (to_uom → from_uom, reciprocal)  
All conversion arithmetic uses BCMath (4 d.p.) — no floating-point

---

# 7. Pricing & Discounts

Buying price, selling price, purchase discount, and sales discount may vary depending on location, batch, lot, or other applicable factors.

Discounts may be applied as a flat amount, a percentage, or other applicable formats.

---

# 8. SaaS Architecture

SaaS Architecture: Types, Tenancy Models, Benefits, and moreSaaS (Software-as-a-Service) architecture is a cloud-based design where a single application instance serves multiple users (tenants) over the internet, focusing on scalability, cost-efficiency, and centralized management. Key approaches include multi-tenant (shared resources) or single-tenant (isolated) models, utilizing microservices and automated deployment to improve flexibility.

Multi-Tenancy: A central, shared infrastructure where all users (tenants) run on the same version of the software.  
Scalability: The system is designed to scale horizontally to accommodate increasing numbers of users or data without performance degradation.  
Centralized Management: Updates and maintenance are applied once to the central system, benefiting all users instantly.  
Security & Data Isolation: Even in shared environments, robust mechanisms are required to ensure tenant data remains private and secure.  
Multi-tenant: Most common, cost-effective model where a single database/application instance serves all customers.  
Single-tenant: Each customer has their own dedicated instance and database, providing higher security and customization but higher costs.  
Microservices: Breaking the application into small, independent services (e.g., billing, user management) that communicate over APIs, enhancing scalability.  
Database Management: Can range from a single database with a TenantID to dedicated databases per tenant, depending on isolation needs.  
Identity & Access Management: Crucial for managing user roles and access across different tenants.

# 9. Nested Hierarchical Organization Unit

A nested hierarchical organization unit is a structural arrangement where smaller organizational entities (subunits) are contained within larger ones, forming a layered, tree-like, or "Russian doll" structure. In this system, each level of the hierarchy constitutes a subset of the level above it, enabling efficient management of large, complex, or geographically dispersed organizations.
